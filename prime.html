<h1>PRIMARY SECTION</h1> 
<img src="prime2.jpg">
<p>Established in 1986, BLA is an “Outstanding School” which prides itself on providing an excellent, broad and balanced curriculum and ensuring high standards in the core subject areas of Reading, Writing and Math. In our relentless drive for excellence, our aim is that all pupils should develop as excellent learners, have excellent social and emotional skills and fulfill their potential</p>
<p>Our children have positive attitudes to learning, high standards of behavior and excellent attainment across the curriculum. The school has supportive parents and inspiring, skilled teachers and excellent support staff. Students are provided with appropriate academic challenges and the breadth and quality of education beyond the core subjects is outstanding. We employ specialist teachers in recognition of the high quality of the work across these areas of the curriculum. ICT is also integrated throughout the curriculum.</p>
<p>We are extremely proud of the varied opportunities that are offered to students across the curriculum and as impressive range of extracurricular activities. Students have opportunities to learn through a wide range of educational visits and events. This is a shared drive to constantly review, improve and enrich our curriculum to ensure learning is relevant and exciting for all students.</p>
<h2>Primary Curriculum</h2>
<h2>Our school curriculum is based on four important principles:</h2>
<ul>
	<li> It is broad: it introduces children to a wide range of knowledge, understanding and skills.</li>
	<li> It is balanced: each area of learning is valued and allocated sufficient time.</li>
	<li>It is differentiated: it matches children’s individual needs, abilities and aptitudes.</li>
	<li> It is relevant: it is designed to interest children and relate to their own life experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>In Grade 1 – 5, learning is organized into core subjects and foundation subjects:</h2>
<h2>Core subjects:</h2>
<p>English (including speaking, listening, reading, writing, spelling and handwriting), Mathematics, Science,Urdu,Social Studies, Islamiat & Nazra, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Art</p> 
<h2>English:</h2>
<p>English has a high priority on our timetable with more time given to it than any other subject and standards in all areas of English are high. We work hard to ensure all children develop excellent literacy skills as they are the key to children succeeding in so many other areas of the curriculum. All children are taught English every day and experience a wealth of speaking and listening activities and opportunities for reading and writing to develop their communication skills. There is a wide-ranging English curriculum ensuring children gain understanding of high-quality fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama, classic and modern and screen based texts. Children write for real audiences and purpose to inspire their writing.</p>
<p>Phonics is an important and enjoyable part of our English teaching and standards in reading are particularly high. Time is set aside each day specifically to teach reading and all children read with their teacher at least weekly. All teachers regularly read aloud to their classes to encourage them to enjoy a greater range of texts and develop their enjoyment of reading.</p>
<h2>Math:</h2>
<p>Standards in mathematics are very good. There is a daily mathematics lesson for all children. Lessons include whole class, group and individual work. Mental maths and problem solving are an important part of every lesson. Learning through a clear progression of mental and written methods, children develop understanding and the skills to carry out calculations independently.</p>
<h2>Science:</h2>
<p>Standards in science are very high and children develop excellent investigative skills from an early age. Children are encouraged to ask questions and to extend their understanding of scientific concepts.</p>
<h2>Examination:</h2>
<p>Mid-term examinations are held at the end of the first term and Annual examination is held at the conclusion of the final term. Term marks reflect a student’s overall progress and are awarded on the basis of Monthly assessment results as well as performance in assignments, projects and class tests.</p>
<p>There is so much more to Beacon Light than academic and extracurricular success and we are pleased to welcome you to our school to experience our exciting, vibrant and happy environment for yourselves.</p>
